## 💡 **Challenges Faced**

1. **Physics Engine Selection**:
   - Switched from **Arcade Physics**  to custom boundaries for better collision handling.

2. **Asset Management**:
   - Cropped images manually for spritesheets and animations.
     
3. **Animations**:
   - Added monkey movement animations with frames for each direction.

4. **Landing Space Logic**:
   - Logic for detecting the monkey's landing required fine-tuning to ensure seamless gameplay.
